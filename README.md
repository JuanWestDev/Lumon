## Overview

Lumon is a full-stack web application inspired by the Apple TV series *Severance*, which explores the concept of work-life separation. This project recreates the fictional Lumon Industries website with a corporate aesthetic, featuring a mock employee portal and a cryptocurrency dashboard powered by the [CoinRanking API](https://coinranking.com/api). The dashboard displays real-time cryptocurrency data, blending the thematic elements of *Severance* with practical API integration. This project showcases my skills in full-stack development, API integration, and responsive design.
